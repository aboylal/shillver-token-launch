ERC20 Token Contract for Shillver ICO

Ideally we want the contract to have x amount of SHILL deducted from the y total supply when the contract is made. The x amount will be sent to an array of ether addresses of those who contributed to the project. The remaining y amount will be stay in the contract address for ICO. For a in N: a >= 1, a SHILL per 1 ETH will be the set rate. The input ETH will be fowarded to a multisig wallet for future development and marketing funds.
